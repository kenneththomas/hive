HIVE/DUMFIX

# Mission

DUMFIX is based off of the FIX 4.2 protocol. Like the name implies, it&#39;s a dumbed down version of FIX. I&#39;m working on this as a personal project to play around with, but perhaps it could evolve into a way to gain a basic understanding of FIX protocol.

The reason why I&#39;m &quot;creating&quot; DUMFIX is because I&#39;m attempting to code extremely crude versions of trading engines that I&#39;ve worked with throughout my career. I&#39;m doing this for fun, so I want to ignore all of the less fun overhead parts of FIX protocol.

The most important aspects of DUMFIX is that it will be:

- Sessionless, DUMFIX engines will not care about logons, sequence numbers, and sendercomp/targetcomp will mostly only be used here for decoration.
- Less required tags â€“ body length, sequence number, any time-related tags will largely be ignored by DUMFIX engines.

The most important aspect of DUMFIX is understanding input/output.

# About the Author

I don&#39;t have a formal computer science background, but I do have a finance background and a keen interest in electronic trading from the technology perspective. I have been working with FIX 4.2 in a project management, testing, and client certification role. While I feel I do excel in the organization and presentational aspects of my job, I want to improve my scripting and programming skills as well.
